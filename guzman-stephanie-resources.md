typing.io linked in the after Mod 0 resources is helping me strengthen my typing skills. I do a quick lesson every day. I started using it a week ago and I've already seen a 10 wpm increase in my speed.

The Anki app helps me with memory retention. I add vocabulary words and concepts to it and it gives me a daily reminder to study cards.

The Notetaking resource linked in the Before Mod 0 resources has been helpful for me to set up my own notes. I'm still figuring out what process works best for me but having that resource as a guide has helped tremendously.
